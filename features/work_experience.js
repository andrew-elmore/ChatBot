My knowledge of React, JavaScript, Redux, HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, and the MERN Stack give me the technical ability to find the solution to these challenges.My background as a financial advisor also impressed on me the importance of looking at a project from the userâ€™s perspective.This ensures that I structure the project in a way that will lead to the best possible experience for that user.
